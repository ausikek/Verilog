# 🖥️ Digital Systems - CIN0130

## 💾 This is my Verilog Modules Repository for my digital systems class, made in 2024.1

## 🎟 It encompasses most of the combinational and sequential logic modules in the structural design.

## ⚙️ It also features a functional 8-bit computer, based on a 3-State-Blocks Finite State Machine, with functional RW Memory and ROM.
